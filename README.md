An implementation by zim96. I am implementing it in stages because I have yet to be comfortable with mathematics behind it. So, I shall list each stage with a new heading an paragraph here in the README.

## Understanding Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Image Compression

I implemented an image compression method using SVD in a Jupyter Notebook named `svd_image_compression`. This allowed me understand the use of SVD for images and how an SVD is calculated via Correlation Matrices.
